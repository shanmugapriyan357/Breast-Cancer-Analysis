Breast Cancer Analysis
This repository contains the code and resources for the Breast Cancer Analysis project, which aims to develop a machine learning model to predict breast cancer based on a dataset of medical measurements. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training and tuning, and a Streamlit app for interactive predictions.

Project Structure
breast_cancer csv/: Contains the dataset csv file.
breast_cancer_analysis/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
app.py: Streamlit application for interactive predictions.
breast_cancer_model/: Saved machine learning models.
README.md: Project documentation.
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/shanmugapriyan357/Breast-Cancer-Analysis.git
cd Breast-Cancer-Analysis
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preparation
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Feature Selection
Implement feature selection using SelectKBest.
Model Training and Tuning
Train and tune the model using Grid Search CV.
Train the model with best parameters.
Save the Model
Save the trained model.
Streamlit App
Create a Streamlit app for interactive predictions (app.py).
Deployment and Version Control
Initialize a Git repository:

bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Push to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/shanmugapriyan357/Breast-Cancer-Analysis.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Submission Requirements
Python scripts in the src/ folder
Streamlit app code in app.py
Model files in the models/ folder
A README.md file documenting the project
Sample Prediction Web Page
Add a heading and space for the sample prediction web page. Provide a screenshot or example of how the Streamlit app looks and functions.
